    #           "Service Law  Female Reservation  Non-Creamy Layer certificate , Change of category , Appellant contended that she did not submit her application under the ‘Reserved Female Category’ on account of her inability to obtain an NCL Certificate which was valid as on the last date of submission of the application form i.e., 01.06.2022 – However, upon the issuance of the Corrigendum, the appellants’ eligibility qua the ‘Reserved Female Category’ came to be revived as the appellant was no longer mandated to furnish an NCL Certificate which was valid as on the last date of submission of the application form but instead was called upon to furnish an NCL Certificate pertaining to current financial year: Held: Admittedly, the appellant i.e., a candidate who was scrupulously following the terms and conditions of the impugned advertisement was constrained to apply under the ‘Open General Category’ only on account of certain logistical limitations prevent- ing her from obtaining a valid NCL Certificate – Consequently, in the absence of the requisite documents evidencing status as a 1224  [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports person belonging to the NCL under the impugned advertisement read with the Circular i.e., a valid NCL Certificate as on the date of submission of the application form, the appellant did not mark ‘yes’ against the specific question pertaining to her status as a person belonging to the NCL – The aforenoted conduct of the appellant is bonafide – Accordingly, the appellant cannot be unfairly deprived of the benefit of female reservation merely on account of the appellant’s honesty and restraint which did not allow her to mark ‘yes’ against a column inquiring about a prospective candidates’ status as a person belonging to the NCL, in the absence of the underlying supporting document – Additionally, other similarly situated candidates have been granted the benefit under the Corrigendum; and their otherwise defective applications have now been considered by the Respondent – The High Court adopted a hypertechnical interpretation of the instructions without appreciating that such an interpretation would nullify the effect of the Corrigendum – Impugned order set aside. However, in the interregnum, on 17.02.2023, the Department of Other Backward Bahujan Welfare issued a corrigendum (the “Corrigendum”) amending Clause 2 (iii) of a circular bearing number CBC-2012/P.No.182/Vijabhaj-1, dated 25.03.2013 issued by Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance, Government of Maharashtra whereunder (i) the procedure of obtaining; and (ii) validity of inter alia  NCL Certificates’ were regulated (the “Circular”). In the aforesaid context, the Appellant i.e., a candidate employed as State Tax Officer in the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) Department, Nodal 3, Pune, Maharashtra submitted her application for the aforesaid examination under the ‘Open General Category’ on account of her inability to produce a valid NCL Certificate as on the last date of submission of the application form. Furthermore, Mr. Sharma has submitted before us that 7 (seven) – 8 (eight) other persons who dishonestly applied under the ‘Reserved Female Category’ without a valid NCL Certificate, have been granted the benefit under the Corrigendum, and subsequently upon producing the NCL Certificate as per the terms of the Corrigendum, the Respondent has proceeded to consider their candidature under the Reserved Female Category.",

Having seen the record, this Court is compelled to draw a conclusion that the officers responsible for evaluation of the tender in question, did not scrutinize the documents submitted by the tenderers along with their bids properly and, with a view to ensure ouster of some eligible contractors and awarding the same to their favourites, have made an attempt to justify their action by giving totally implausible reasoning.” In para 31, High Court observed- “But, for the reasons, best known to the authority, it still proceeded to award the tender in favour of M/s.

The trial court by its judgment dated 10.09.2013  convicted  the  petitioner  and  other  co-accused  in SC  No.114  of  2013  under  Sections  120-B,  365,  366  read  with Section 120-B IPC, 307 read with Section 120-B IPC, 376(2)(g), 377 read with Section 120-B IPC, 302 read with Section 120-B IPC, 395, 397 read with Section 120-B IPC, 201 read with Section 120-B IPC and  412 IPC. The petitioner has primarily raised the following grounds to challenge the order of rejection of his mercy petition:- 11(i)non-furnishing  of  copy  of  records  pertaining  to  the rejection  of  the  mercy  petition  of  the  petitioner  under Right to Information Act, 2005; (ii)relevant materials were kept out of consideration; (iii)torture  while  in custody  and  consequential  illness  and mental  illness  of  the  petitioner  and  non-placing  of materials pertaining to health condition of the petitioner; (iv)illegal solitary confinement; and (v)Bias order was passed with prejudiced mind. The position, therefore, is undeniable that judicial review of the order of the President or the Governor under Article 72 or Article 161, as the case may be, is available and their orders can be impugned on the following grounds: (a) that the order has been passed without application of mind; (b) that the order is mala fide; (c)  that  the  order  has  been  passed  on  extraneous  or  wholly irrelevant considerations; (d) that relevant materials have been kept out of consideration; (e) that the order suffers from arbitrariness"],

    "Murder" : ["We are, therefore, of the considered view that an Inquiry Commission  needs  to  be  constituted  for  inquiring  into  the circumstances in which the four accused persons, namely, Mohammed Arif, Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, Jolu Shiva and Jollu Naveen, were killed in Hyderabad on 6th December 2019. 803 of 2019 has been registered under Sections 307, 224, 394, 332 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 25(1-B)(a) and 27 of the Arms Act, and under Section 174 read with Section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Four persons, namely, Mohammed Arif, Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, Jolu Shiva and Jollu Naveen, were arrested in connection with the said offence. The accused persons, it is alleged, refused to surrender and, therefore, the police had no option but to fire to save themselves and prevent the accused from escaping. Shri Mukul Rohatgi states that the aforesaid encounter is being examined by the Revenue Divisional Officer and Sub-Divisional Magistrate,  Shadnagar,  in  terms  of  magisterial  inquiry  under Section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the State Government has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by the Commissioner of Police to inquire and investigate into the offence."],

Therefore, in view of the above discussion the period from 18.12.2000, when the execution application was filed to 29.01.2005, when the prior proceeding was dismissed, has to be excluded while computing period of limitation, which results in the execution application filed by the Plaintiff, being within the limitation period prescribed under Article 182 of the Limitation Act as well, which is 3 years. … … (2) In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.” …. A conjoint and careful reading of sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 14 makes it clear that an applicant who has prosecuted another civil proceeding with due diligence, before a forum which is unable to entertain the same on account of defect of jurisdiction or any other cause of like nature, is entitled to exclusion of the time during which the applicant had been prosecuting such proceeding, in computing the period of limitation. On analysis of the said section, it becomes evident that the following conditions must be satisfied before Section 14 can be pressed into service: (1) Both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; (2) The prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith; (3) The failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature; (4) The earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue; and (5) Both the proceedings are in a court.” 31."],
